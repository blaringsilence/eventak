# Eventak
For the Advanced Programming course, Spring 2016.

## Premise
A program for event planners to log and organize events of different types, as well as issue tickets, invitations and reports.
It's divided into 3 smaller programs:

  - **Eventak-GUI**: The main program (JavaFX). For use by the agency's employees to create, edit, and organize events.
  - **Eventak-Client** and **Eventak-Server**: Client-server application to buy tickets of a certain tier from a certain event.
  
The program is meant to be minimal, and designed to hit several course targets (file I/O instead of a regular database, etc).
